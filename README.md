# JavaScript

## Calculator.js 
### This file is having the script that is required to build a simple calculator. I have used two techniques:
### 1. if-else
### 2. switch

## document.html 
### This file is a good example of inner html dom object. We used inner HTML to change the text that is being displayed to some other text.
